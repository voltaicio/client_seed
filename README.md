# client_seed - a starter project for AngularJS apps

This project is largely based on
[angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed/), but has been stripped
down considerably and customized to better fit my needs.

## Setup

Clone the repo:
```
$ git clone git@github.com:voltaicio/client_seed.git
$ cd client_seed
```

Install dependencies (the following command will also install bower dependencies):
```
$ npm install
```

## Linting + Testing
```
$ gulp
```

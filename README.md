# client_seed - a starter project for AngularJS apps

This project is largely based on
[angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed/), but has been stripped
down considerably and customized to better fit my needs.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/voltaicio/client_seed.git
$ cd client_seed
```

Install dependencies:
```
$ npm install
```

## Testing
